Graphotron 2000 v0.1.2
======================
The Graphotron 2000 is a part and a plugin for KSP used to plot sensor output and flight information.

Changelog
---------
v0.1.2: Added dynamic pressure graph

v0.1.1: Initial _working_ release

v0.1: Initial release

Installation
------------
Place the "Parts" and "Plugins" folder contents into the respective folders in your KSP install. Restart the game.

Usage
-----
The Graphotron 2000 can be found in the Science tab of the VAB/SPH.

Right-click the Graphotron 2000 in flight to bring up the interface. Click the "Sources" button to select data sources for your plot. Set the plot resolution (how much time equals to 1 pixel of plot width). Click the "Draw Plot" button to start collecting and plotting data, click it again to stop.

When plotting is active, data is always collected from all available sources. You can switch sources on and off while plotting without loss of data.

Click "Save to PNG" to save the current plot to a .png file, located at _[your KSP folder]/PluginData/Graphotron/[date time].png_

When the Graphotron UI is hidden, plotting does not stop. The Graphotron 2000 will continue plotting until stopped manually, no ElectricCharge is available, or it is destroyed or detached from the craft.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you are not getting data from your sensors, check that they are activated and attached to the same vessel as the Graphotron.

If the "Draw plot" button keeps deactivating itself, check there is enough ElectricCharge available to power the Graphotron.
